# MiscDiscordBots
A repository of miscellaneous Discord bots that I make on whims.

# Organization
Each of the bots is given its own folder and a single master `.py` file to contain the entirety of its code.  It would not be difficult to create one general purpose bot for all of the different purposes that each bot serves, but I prefer this method of organization (I also like having a lot of different bots in my Discord test server.)
