# MiscDiscordBots
A repository of miscellaneous Discord bots that I make on whims.

# Organization
Each of the bots is given its own folder and a single master `.py` file to contain the entirety of its code.  It would not be difficult to create one general purpose bot for all of the different purposes that each bot serves, but I prefer this method of organization (I also like having a lot of different bots in my Discord test server.)

# The Bots
### Role Bot
This bot is configured with a preset list of roles and Discord message reactions to go along with each role.  When the bot is run, it sends a message to a pre-configured channel in your Discord server that allows users to assign themselves roles by reaction to this message.  Below is an example of what the message looks like the first time the bot is run.
